# About
Bracket Highlighter matches a variety of brackets such as: `[]`, `()`, `{}`, `""`, `''`, `<tag></tag>`, and even custom brackets.

This is a fork of pyparadigm's _SublimeBrackets_ and _SublimeTagmatcher_ (both are no longer available).  I forked this to fix some issues I had and to add some features I had wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching.  This cuts down on the parallel searching that is now streamlined in one search.  Since then, I have rewritten the entire code base to bring more flexibility, speed, and features.
