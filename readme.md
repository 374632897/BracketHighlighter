#About
This is a fork of pyparadigm's [SublimeBrackets](https://github.com/pyparadigm/SublimeBrackets "Go to SublimeBrackets.")
I forked this to fix some issues I had and to add some features I wanted.  I also wanted to improve the efficiency of the matching.
I also merged in pyparadigm's SublimeTagmatcher as well.  This cuts down on the parallel searching that is now streamlined in one search.
