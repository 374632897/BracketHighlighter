#About
This is a fork of pyparadigm's SublimeBrackets.  Pyparadigm's plugin is great, but it had a small issue that I needed 
fixed, so I forked it to remedy it.  Afterwards, I started adding features that I wanted...so here I am with a branch 
that is deviating more and more from the original.  If the original ever pulls these changes in, I will stop support.

# Installation
* Latest version: [Click here to download.](https://github.com/facelessuser/SublimeBrackets/zipball/master "Click here to download lastest version.")
- Must be running **Sublime Text 2 Build 2108** or higher.
- Drop the folder into your Sublime Text 2 packages directory.

# Features
- Customizable bracket matching for [],(),{}, and <>
- Enable or disable the matching of specific brackets
- Configurable search threshold to not match brackets that are far away and allow for snappier editing
- Shortcut to override threshold and demand matching of brackets that are close or far away
- Works with multi-select.

# Options
- Edit the options in "SublimeBrackets.sublime-settings"
- Change the Scope, Outline, and Icon for bracket types.
- Enable or disable specific bracket matching.
- Enable or disable the use of threshold.
- Set search threshold to desired range.  You can set to zero and it will only match on demand with shortcuts.
- Save the file and your options should take effect immediately.
