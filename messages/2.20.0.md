# BracketHighlighter 2.20.0

## New

- BracketHighlighter will (hopefully) update dependencies to latest versions on upgrade.  This can be disabled if desired in the settings.
- Popup hints are now enabled by default and are no longer considered experimental.  Must have ST 3116+ to use.
- Popup hints now calculate emphasis from style settings by default.  To use/re-enable custom emphasis, use the setting `use_custom_popup_bracket_emphasis`.
