# BracketHighlighter 2.18.0

## New

- Added **experimental** option `show_offscreen_bracket_popup` for ST 3 version 3116+ to show a popup showing line context of other off screen bracket when hovering over visible bracket.  Also provides a link to jump to off screen bracket.  Disabled by default.  Depending on how it is received, it may stick around. See documentation for more info.
