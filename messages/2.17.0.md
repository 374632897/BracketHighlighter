# BracketHighlighter 2.17.0

## New

- Added `show_in_widgets` in `bh_core.sublime-settings` to allow bracket highlighting in widgets (such as regex search box).

- If `show_in_widgets` is enabled, a plugin can prevent highlighting in an output panel (or other widget if the view can be targeted) by setting `bracket_highlighter.ignore` to `True` in the view settings.

- Added CMake highlighting
